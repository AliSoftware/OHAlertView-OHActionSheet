These two classes make it easier to use UIAlertView and UIActionSheet classes by using blocks.

This allows you to provide directly the code to execute (as a block) in return to the tap on a button,
instead of declaring a delegate and implementing the corresponding methods.

This also has the huge advantage of simplifying the code especially when using multiple UIAlertViews and UIActionSheets
in the same object (as in such case, it is not easy to have a clean code if you share the same delegate)


Note: Blocks a a feature introducted in (and only compatible starting) iOS 4.x and MacOSX 10.6

----------
Example:

	[UIAlertViewEx showAlertWithTitle:@"Alert Demo"
							  message:@"Welcome to this sample"
						 cancelButton:nil
							 okButton:@"Thanks!"
					   onButtonTapped:^(UIAlertViewEx* alert, NSInteger buttonIndex)
	 {
		 NSLog(@"button tapped: %d",buttonIndex);
	 }];

----------

NOTE FOR PRE-OSX 10.6 and PRE-iOS 4.0
	This class is designed to be used with blocks, which are a new feature introduced in OSX 10.6 and iOS 4.0. 
	
	To assure the compatibility with pre-iOS4 and pre-OSX10.6, UIAlertViewEx also propose the possibility
	to associate a userInfo dictionary to the UIAlertView, and specify a @selector to call on a given delegate,
	so that you can at least specify a different delegate method in case you have multiple UIAlertViews using the same delegate.
